Motivation:  using the docker runtime would allow us to put the docker runtime already in ZMI (which is so far unclear if we may do that with Docker desktop). Also the endusers will not need to have a License for Docker Desktop.
We should investigate how much effort it would be to use the docker runtime instead of docker desktop:
Check if this works for example along those lines (or something newer)
